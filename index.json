Path-Link Graph Neural Network for IP Network Performance Prediction. In 2021 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM) (pp. 170-177). IEEE. Paper [PDF]\nMotivation Dynamic resource provisioning and quality assurance for the plethora of end-to-end slices running over 5G and B5G networks require advanced modeling capabilities. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have already proven their efficiency for network performance prediction. We verified a SOTA model RouteNet by a new implementation in the PyTorch ML library. Next, with the aims to improve accuracy and scalability, an alternative Path-Link neural network (PLNet) architecture is proposed and evaluated.\nPerformance We observed slightly better accuracy and better generalization.\nImproved Scalability Largely improved scalability is observed.\nFuture Works There are several future directions for the continuation of this study. Firstly, RouteNet and PLNet models have good potential for reinforcement learning. For example, dynamic resource allocation. Secondly, although we consider more generic scenarios than 5G in this paper, it is still a good starting point for going further into more specific 5G scenarios. That is to say, extending the comparison and application of the models on more extensive networks and in the context of 5G scenarios like end-to-end slicing are also promising research topics.\n","date":1596153600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596153600,"objectID":"59e3dd82d181f5dcb4fc9524d856bac9","permalink":"https://yanko96.github.io/project/plnet/","publishdate":"2020-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/plnet/","section":"project","summary":"Path-Link Graph Neural Network for IP Network Performance Prediction","tags":["Deep Learning","Graph Neural Network"],"title":"Path-Link Graph Neural Network for IP Network Performance Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yangzhe Kong","Dmitry Petrov","Vilho Raisanen","Alexander Ilin"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have already proven their efficiency for network performance prediction. GNN architecture matches well the structures usually met in communications networks. In this paper, the focus is on the IP transport network as one of the end-to-end 5G architecture domains. The recently published RouteNet GNN is taken as a reference and starting point for our study. RouteNet performance is verified by a new implementation in the PyTorch ML library. Next, an alternative Path-Link neural network (PLNet) architecture is proposed and evaluated. After hyper-parameter tuning for both models, the results show that PLNet and RouteNet achieve a similar accuracy level. The advantage of PLNet is in parallel architecture. It is demonstrated that its inference speed is not sensitive to the length of the network's paths.","tags":[],"title":"Path-Link Graph Neural Network for IP Network Performance Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project served as the final project of course CS-E5740 Complex Networks, Aalto University.
